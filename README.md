## Course Outline
This is the first course where deformation of solid bodies and the underlying concepts are introduced to undergraduate students. The course begins by building foundation of the concepts of stress and strain in three-dimensional deformable bodies. It further uses these concepts to study extension, torsion and bending of beams. The one-dimensional theory of beams are also introduced. Various theories of failure that are critical for design of machine elements in industry will also be discussed.

## Course Layout
- Mathematical preliminaries and notation; Concept of Traction vector; Concept of Stress tensor
- Stress tensor and its representation in Cartesian coordinate system; Transformation of stress matrix; Equations of equilibrium; Symmetry of stress tensor
- State of stress in simple cases; Principal stress components and principal planes; Maximizing shear component of traction; Mohr’s circle
- Stress invariants; Octahedral Plane; Decomposition of stress tensor; Concept of strain and strain tensor
- Longitudinal, shear and volumetric strains; Local infinitesimal rotation; Strain compatibility condition
- Linear stress-strain relation for isotropic bodies; Relation between material constants
- Stress and strain matrices in cylindrical coordinate system; Equations of equilibrium in cylindrical coordinate system
- Axisymmetric deformations: combined extension-torsion-inflation of a cylinder
- Bending of beams having symmetrical and non-symmetrical cross-section
- Shear center, Shear flow in thin and open cross-section beams; Euler Bernouli and Timoshenko beam theories; beam buckling
- Energy methods, Reciprocal relations, Castigliano’s theorem, Deflection of straight and curved beams using energy method
- Various theories of failure and their application
